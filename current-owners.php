        <div class="tab-info active">
        <p>
            There could be a number of reasons of why this happened. The first and most obvious is that the tenant didn't pay. You need to look at your statements first to determine this. If they did pay there normally would be rent received in the income column of your owner statement. Please give your property manager a call if you have any concerns and they will be glad to answer any questions you might have.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second most common problem is that your expenses exceeded the income. You should then find one or more receipts or paid invoices in with your statement. In addition there is a listing of expenses paid on your statement in the Expense column.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final most likely reason is that your funds are being held in anticipation of authorized work being completed. Let's say you need a new roof and instead of you sending $2500.00 to us now, you elect to have the rents build up in your account until there is enough to have the roofing work completed.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> I THOUGHT MY TENANT MOVED IN ON THE FIRST, WHY IS MY CHECK SHORT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        The most common reason is expenses. Normally when we take over a new property and put in a tenant for the first time, there could be as many as three separate reasons why your check would appear to be short. First of all would be that we charge a Tenant Placement fee for getting you a tenant. Secondly, there could be a referral fee to an outside broker if indeed another office supplied us/you with a qualified tenant that was accepted. And finally, there is the Owner Reserve amount that is kept in your account for expenses that may occur between receiving rents.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WILL I GET THE TENANTS WHOLE DEPOSIT IF THERE ARE REPAIRS NEEDED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Sometimes the hardest thing to get owners to understand is that their personal living style can not be mandated unto a tenant. So, if you would replace a mini blind simply because one of the fingers going across it was bent, doesn't mean that would be imposed on a tenant as a deduction from their deposit. The courts look at it more from a reasonable wear and tear standpoint and what might be considered average living conditions. We've had owners replace all the carpet in a unit because of some small stains in one back bedroom and expect the tenants deposit to foot the bill. It doesn't work that way. You can only charge a tenant for damage, and other work that needs to be done beyond what would rationally be considered normal wear and tear.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT HAPPENS IF THE TENANT HASN'T PAID AFTER THE 5 DAY PAY OR QUIT IS UP?
        <div class="tab-info">
        At that point we file with the appropriate Court for an Eviction. Depending which city the property is located in, it can take from one to three business days to process. After that, the court forwards the signed order to the Constable's office. The Constable then posts a 24 hour Notice to Vacate. That posting can take one to two days. From there, the Constable goes out the following day, with a locksmith, and physically removes everyone in the property. After that it usually takes a day or two to get the new keys from the locksmith.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW SOON CAN YOU GET THE ROOF OR A/C REPLACED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        It takes longer to get roof bids than a/c bids. Assuming that there is enough money in your account to cover the expense, we can usually get an entire a/c replaced in 3-4 days, and a roof would take 3-4 weeks.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> THE TENANT IS LATE AND I CAN'T MAKE MY MORTGAGE PAYMENT, WHAT DO I DO?
        <div class="tab-info">
        We advise all our owners to not only keep their mortgage payments paid one month in advance, but also to keep enough repair money set aside for new water heaters or air conditioning units. If you don't, you'll end up in a situation where the tenant doesn't pay and your credit is going to get damaged. Short term solutions are to borrow the money. Get an advance on your credit card. The interest you pay is cheaper than the damage that will be done to your credit.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> THE TENANTS LEASE ISN'T UP, HOW CAN THEY JUST GET UP AND MOVE OUT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        If written laws, and written "contracts", were never broken, then we wouldn't need police, there wouldn't be any crime, and rarely would anybody need to go to court. Unfortunately, a piece of paper is not going to keep a tenant in the property if he needs to move.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> THIS IS THE TENANTS SECOND MONTH, WHY IS MY CHECK SHORT AGAIN?
        <div class="tab-info">
        In addition to all of the possible reasons given above, the most common reason is because the tenant moved in, in the <strong>middle</strong> of the prior month. When this happens, we make the tenant pay for a full month of rent at move-in, and then pay the smaller, prorated portion the second month. Doing it this way prevents a tenant of say moving in on the 23rd and only paying one week in rent, and then not paying again and we immediately have to start an eviction. So usually what happens is that they pay the full months rent at move-in, from which Referral Fees, Tenant Placement Fees, Owner Reserve etc is subtracted from, then the second month the tenant only owes for a couple of weeks or so, and the check is again less than what an owner will normally expect to receive.

        <div class="tab-info">
        Hopefully you previously set up an appointment ahead of time with your property manager. If you didn't, and you want to see it today, then the tenant will have to "allow" you in. Otherwise, you have to give the tenant 24 hours written notice.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> ISN'T THE TENANT SUPPOSSED TO PAY THE TRASH? WHY AM I GETTING BILLED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        The trash company is one of the utilities that can lien your property if the bills aren't paid. Consequently, it is in your best interest to pay the trash bill out of your account and then we bill the tenant. That way the tenant doesn't get behind and we are able to monitor the utility bills that can directly impact your property. Usually the tenant then reimburses you with their next rent payment.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> I THINK I WANT TO SELL, CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Certainly. We are a licensed Real Estate office and can handle sales as well as management. In fact, most owners prefer to go through us. If we have been managing you property for some time then we usually will take 2.5% commission and offer 3.5% commission to outside brokers. That extra half a percent makes a big difference in getting offers on your property over other available properties.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE BACK INTO THE PROPERTY, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TENANT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Assuming that the tenant has a valid lease agreement, and they want to stay until the end of the lease term, you probably won't be able to move back in. If they are on month-to-month, then you will need to go through the 30 day eviction process. Of course none of this will happen if the tenant decides they want to move and just move out. We've seen owners financially help the tenants move. Sometimes this is cheaper in the long run than waiting for them to move and having the owner make other interim arrangements.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT ARE THESE OTHER INCOME FIGURES ON MY STATEMENT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Usually these "other" income receipts are reimbursements of one kind or another from the tenant. Sometimes they are utility refunds after a tenant has taken over or possibly it is a payment from the tenant reimbursing the owner for utilities, such as trash or electricity, that the owner paid on the tenants behalf while the tenant was getting the utilities transferred over. There are many reasons. Just contact your property manager and they will be glad to explain it to you.

        We adjust or spread out the work load in an attempt to give a high level of service to everyone. As we continue to grow, at times we will add an additional manager and then adjust all of our current accounts to provide better service for everyone.

        <div class="tab-info">
        Maybe. It depends pretty much on whether there is a Month-To-Month Lease Agreement in place. If there is, then we can issue a 45 day notice to increase rent. Otherwise, if there is a long term lease in place you would have to wait for that to finish before increasing the rent.

        <div class="tab-info">
        You can have anyone you choose do the work you want on your property. However, if they are not insured you always stand the chance that they could get injured and then they will end up owning your building. We have found that about 95% of the time, using friends or anyone else that is not in the construction/repair business, full-time, is a huge mistake. The work is almost always lacking and rarely is it completed in a timely manner. If you insist on using someone like this, you will be the one ordering the work, inspecting the work, and paying for the work. Since there is so much at risk, we normally will not get involved since we will want to keep an arms length distance from the transaction just in case there is a problem.

        <div class="tab-info">
        The city, in conjunction with the mayors office, is trying to 'clean up' areas of the city. Their methods include using inspectors from the Neighborhood Services Department to inspect and cite properties for code violations. They also work hand in hand with the Fire Department to achieve the same results. If you do not comply with their requests they have the power to shut down your building and eventually demolish it. You of course have legal recourse and there is a system in place where you can take your case before the city council. This is a lengthy process. Keep in mind it is the city that is backing these people.
