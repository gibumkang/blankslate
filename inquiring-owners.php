        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> AM I REQUIRED TO HAVE A PROPERTY MANAGER?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Yes and No. Nevada State law requires that you have a representative in the county or within 60 miles of the rental property. Below is an exerpt of the statute:
        <p>
            <strong>
            NRS 118A.260 Disclosure of names and addresses of managers and owners; emergency telephone number; service of process.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The landlord, or any person....
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) The name..</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            (b) A telehone number at which a responsible person who resides in the county or within 60 miles of where the premises are located may be called in case of emergency.</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            That also means that an owner can not use a 1-800 number or an answering service for "taking calls". An owner doesn't necessarily have to use a property manager. There are two other options. First, the owner can manage the rental themselves if they meet the above criteria of living in the county or within 60 miles of the rental or they can engage someone as an employee to handle the rental. Of course that gets messy with taxes, deductions, workers compensation, insurance etc.

        <div class="tab-info">
        Vacancy factors throughout the city are well below 8%. The fastest turn <strong>without</strong> having a tenant previously lined up has been 1.5 hours. The average time is about 24 days. Many factors influence demand. The biggest of course will be price. Price actually has two faces. Price as compared to other similar properties, and price in and of itself. If the subject rental is $2,500.00 per month, there is a much smaller market from which to draw a qualified tenant than for a property priced below $1000.00 per month. This means that usually it will take longer to rent a property with a higher rental price.

When tourism is negatively impacted, there are job layoffs and less spending, renters and their families move in together... that weakens rental demand.

        <ol>

All down payments, earnest money deposits, rents, or other money which he receives, on behalf of his principal or any other person, must be deposited in the account unless all persons who have an interest in the money have agreed otherwise in writing. A real estate broker in his discretion may pay to any seller or the seller's agent the whole or any portion of such deposit. <strong>The real estate broker is personally responsible and liable for such deposit at all times.</strong> A real estate broker shall not permit any advance payment of money belonging to others to be deposited in the real estate broker's business or personal account or to be commingled with any money he may have on deposit.</li>

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW MUCH SECURITY DEPOSIT DO YOU CHARGE THE TENANT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        As a general rule of thumb we usually get a minimum of 90% of the rent. So, if the monthly rent was $1000.00 we would normally take in $900.00 as a security deposit. However, there are many factors that make up the figure. Are there pets, gate cards, pool keys, furniture, garage door openers, etc. Is it a brand new home or is the property made of stone from the dark ages? Why 90%? Because we do not want the tenant, or the courts, to think that it is last months rent. Also it usually only takes 15 days to evict a tenant. Assuming no extensive damage the deposit should cover most of the expenses and unpaid rent. Extremely high security deposits are great if you can get them.... but they also keep good tenants from being able to afford the overall move-in.

        <div class="tab-info">
        The eviction process in Nevada when compared to other areas of the country is fast. We normally begin the eviction process on the 6th of the month by posting a 5 Day Pay or Quit Notice at the property. When the mandatory time has expired and the tenants have still not met their obligations we will file the appropriate paperwork (Affidavit of Complaint, Order for Summary Eviction, Instructions to the Constable etc.) with the Justice Court and Constables office. Usually between 2-4 business days later the tenants will be physically removed from the property and the locks will be changed. The entire process averages about 15 days.

        <div class="tab-info">
        There are basically two ways. If you know where the x-tenant is, you will have to sue him in court for either damages, rent, or both. Suing for damages can be difficult since proving who caused them after the tenant has moved out is challenging. If you don't know where the tenant is, which is usually the case, then the account can be placed with a collection agency. They will attempt to collect any outstanding balances and usually charge up to 50% of what is collected as their fee.

        Ultimately, in any pricing structure, with any company, the owner does. We decided to charge less to place a new tenant than most firms do but pass through any advertising costs. In the long run this usually saves the owner money. Why? Because in many cases we don't have to advertise at all. Why pay a firm Â½ of the first months rent and they absorb the advertising costs. There is a possibility that you're paying for nothing. On the other hand, if it is a difficult property to rent and needs extensive advertising, it shouldn't be the property managements obligation to absorb those extra expenses. We keep it simple.... you're charged for exactly what you get. We give you a copy of the advertising bill from the newspaper and they break down all the charges by property.

        We normally do not have any costs, however your situation or property may require some expense if it is not ready to rent. Many owners, as the first act of business, need us to evict a tenant. Of course there will be eviction and court costs etc. that will need to be funded before we get involved. Or possibly, the property needs a major overhaul requiring plumbing work, landscaping, roofing, painting, new carpet, fixtures etc. In those instances, since we have never been involved with the property before, we charge 15% of the renovation costs to handle getting the property ready to rent. If your property is basically ready to go, then there are no up front fees.

However, if you are referring to unprotected classes such as pets, smokers, drug dealers etc., then yes you have a choice.

        Being a landlord and having rentals is a 'business'. With any business or investment there comes with it a certain amount of risk. The most realistic answer to the question is that you "can't be sure" of anything. However, you can take the necessary steps to reduce your risk by using a property manager that checks a tenants background, makes them sign a solid lease agreement, and checks on the tenant periodically. Always prepare for the worst and hope for the best. It's only a small percentage of people that do major amounts of harm to a property. On the other hand, there is also a small percentage of tenants that will go out of their way to improve the property like putting in landscaping, footing the bill for painting, or putting in a patio or driveway. Most people fall in the middle. There are no guarantees in life.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT PETS AND SMOKERS?
        <div class="tab-info">
        They exist and make up large paying demographic groups. Let's take pets. Tenants know that only a <strong>small percentage</strong> of owners 'allow' pets. Consequently, many pet owners feel they must deceive a landlord about having a pet. They justify it in their mind because they don't see their pet as being a problem. This means that on occasion you will rent to a person without pets only to find later on that they have a pet. At this point you have a decision to make. Remember, the property is an investment. The question you need to ask yourself is..if the pet has caused damage, and you evict the tenant because of the pet, will you be better off? You will get as much of the deposit as possible to make the repairs and you will have a vacancy.... no income. If you let the pet stay <strong>(assuming no more damages),</strong> you will still have to make the repairs when the tenant decides to leave, but you will have the income while the tenant is in the property. If the pet isn't causing any harm, it's always better to let them stay. The same goes for smokers. We have had properties where all the carpet had to be replaced, and the unit painted twice, just to get rid of the smoke stains and odors. The choice, from a risk standpoint would be to avoid all smokers and pet owners. The reality is, they're not always going to tell you the truth and you will end up with them anyway. So, maybe it would be better to allow both groups but put up restrictions. It's not an easy question to answer. For the most part it depends on you. It's your property. The more people you exclude, potentially the longer it will take to rent.... and on average the vacancy will always cost more than making the repairs.

It's free, until you actually benefit from it. Lets say that your property rents for $1000 a month. We normally offer up to $250 referral fee to other realtors who bring us a qualified tenant that is accepted. That means that if by using the MLS your property is rented just 8 days sooner than it would have been otherwise, you've saved yourself money.... ($1000/30=33.33 33.33x8= 266.64). It doesn't cost anything to list and the referral fee comes out of the first months rent.

In other words, we don't send a handyman to repair or replace an electrical box or breaker board. The chances of causing a fire are to high, so we would use an electrician. However, we wouldn't use an electrician to change out some light bulbs or replace a light socket or switch, something with little or low risk, we would use a handyman. So, each instance and what is involved is evaluated and the best person is selected based on risk and cost.

        Yes. We have several Property Managers that speak other languages. Currently we can converse in Spanish, Tai, and Lao.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> CAN YOU JUST GET ME A TENANT AND I'LL MANAGE THE PROPERTY MYSELF?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Unfortunately no, for a couple of reasons. First, there is the slim possibility that you or the tenant have some sort of falling out and somehow we get dragged into the mess even though the only thing we did was basically show the property. The second reason is that Nevada State Law requires all out of state owners to have a live contact person in the county in which they own their rental. It is illegal for an owner to handle a rental property here without a live representative.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> THE PERSON I SPOKE TO ON THE PHONE ISN'T THE PROPERTY MANAGER I GOT, HOW COME?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Handling multiple properties is time intensive. It's extremely difficult to do from behind a desk. Consequently, most of the property managers spend a great deal of time out in the field, at the properties. We have yet to figure out how a Property Manager can adequately show the inside of your property from behind their desk in the office. Consequently, most of the time you will speak to someone in the office that is available to answer your questions, but may not be the best person suited for your type of property. We then assign the property to the person we feel can do the best job.
