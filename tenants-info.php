            Our goal is to process your applications as quickly as possible so that you will be able to make a determination on your housing needs without delay. Unfortunately, sometimes we are held up in this endeavor because of our inability to get ahold of previous landlords, current landlords, or employers. The more information you can provide on your Application, the easier it is to complete processing. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WORK ON YOUR APPLICATION IF IT IS NOT SIGNED AND DATED. Signing the paperwork authorizes us to do the background checks and the people we make the inquiries to, to release the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applicants with roommates will need separate applications. Non-refundable Application fees vary with the property and property manager and are subject to change at anytime. Having said that, usually they are $60.00 per adult. These funds need to be in the form of cash, or money order.
        </p>
        <p>
            False, inaccurate, or misleading information on your application is grounds for denial. Make sure your paperwork is as accurate as possible.
        </p>
        <h3>Application - Processing Time:</h3>
        <p>
        It usually takes about 24 hours to process your application. If you are in dire need to move in faster, like today, within the next couple of hours, it probably isn't going to happen. If you are still looking for a place you can see our available properties by clicking here... RENTALS
        </p>
        <h3>Fee, deposit, and payment process:</h3>
        <p>
            As a reminder all initial funds for your application, rent, and deposit need to be in the form of cashiers check, or money order. We need you to separate the application fee payment from the rent, and the rent from the deposit. Each of these "parts" goes into a different bank account. The application fee is non-refundable. Once a deposit is taken for the property, we pull it off the market and earmark it for you. Should you change your mind, or find yourself unable to complete the transaction for any reason, you will forfeit the money you've paid. This in turn becomes compensation to the owner for having taken it off the market in your behalf and potentially losing other renters that would have been in a position to move forward.
        </p>
        <h3>Application:</h3>
        <p>
        If you are still reading, we will have to assume that you have seen a specific property and would like to complete an application and addendums. Click below to download PDF formatted instructions, application, and addendums.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> Moving In - Keys
        <div class="tab-info">
        <p>
        This is an exciting time, and also a stressful one. Many times, for various reasons, tenants find themselves between a rock and a hard place. They are moving in from out of town, they made their way the best they could and still, they haven't actually "secured" the property before finally arriving.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting Keys:</h3>
        <p>
        Getting the keys is of course very simple, but for some people circumstances make it difficult. We do not release keys to anyone unless all of the following criteria are met...
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your application is approved and ALL of your lease paperwork has been signed by ALL parties.</li>
            <li>ALL required funds have been received for rent and security deposit in the form of cashiers check or money order.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it.</p>
        <h3>Office staff availability:</h3>
        <p>
        New tenants need to remember that we are usually not open or available on weekends unless by appointment. This is the time most people move. Consequently, you will need to take care of all the necessary paperwork and finances a day or two before you actually plan on physically moving in.
        </p>
        <h3>Additional keys:</h3>
        <p>
        Another thing to remember is that we do not give you a set of keys for everyone in the family. If you want or need additional sets, including garage door or gate openers, pool keys etc., then you will need to pay for and make arrangements yourself to have those made or get them from the Homeowners Association if you live in a gated community.
        </p>
        <h3>Early move-in:</h3>
        <p>
        Lastly, we rarely, if ever let anyone into the property before their lease actually begins. It brings about too many liability issues.

        <div class="tab-info">
            <p>
            If you are not independently wealthy, then you should carry Renters Insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>True or False?</strong> Your landlord is responsible for any damage to your personal belongings?
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>False</strong> - All you need to do is look in the paper on any given day and you will see that crimes have been committed and catastrophes like fire and floods that have taken place... nobody is exempt. Accidents happen, they happen all the time. Nobody plans them, that's why they are called accidents.
            </p>
            <p>
            The owner carries insurance to protect his property, the real estate. If a water pipe bursts, it isn't going to be the owners responsibility to replace your personal items. Every year we have tenants lose their belongings because something happens.... GET INSURANCE!

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> Smoking & Pets
        <div class="tab-info">
            <p>How can tenants keep their smoking or pets from becoming a problem?</p>        
            <h3>Smoking:</h3>
            <p>If you must smoke, then the next best thing is to adopt a habit of never smoking in the house. Many smokers never realize the damage they are causing. It is next to impossible to get stale smoke odors out of carpeting. The staining of walls, floors, and ceilings is so gradual, that a tenant living in the property doesn't even notice the gradual transformation. It isn't until they move, that removed pictures and wall hangings then tell the tale. Usually a minimum of one coat of sealer followed by a high quality paint is needed to mask both the discoloration and the odor. Painting a property twice isn't cheap.</p>
            <h3>Pets in general:</h3>
            <p>
            Pets pose can pose a similar problem. Again, urination on carpeting can be gradual and possibly go somewhat unnoticed. However, unlike smoke, urine soaks through to and into padding where it becomes trapped. Usually, a regular carpet cleaning will not solve the problem. In addition, large dogs and cats can tear up carpet, walls, and doors. The best defense is to have pets that can't destroy the property, such as fish, birds and reptiles. Other than that, have your pet well trained and keep them outside as much as possible.
            </p>
            <h3>Dogs/cats:</h3>
            <p>As a general rule of thumb, the smaller the breed of dog, the better your chances are of getting your application approved. It's tough for a Chihuahua to do much damage.</p>
            <h3>Pet Deposit:</h3>
            <p>
            We usually charge an additional MINIMUM deposit amount of $300.00 per head for pets. Of course that is assuming that the owner is going to allow pets in the first place.

        <div class="tab-info">
        <p>
        When you move into a property you will need to get the utilities put into your name. If we have the power on when you sign your lease, we usually allow a couple of days before we shut them off. If you are renting a house, it's possible that we will have the trash bill sent to our office and it will be charged to your account. The trash company is not good about keeping accounts current and consequently this is something we must monitor at the office.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> Paying Rent
        <div class="tab-info">
        <h3>When Rent Is Due vs Being Late</h3>
        <p>
        Tenants, somehow get confused between when rent is due and when rent is late. The time frame in which late fees can be applied, has absolutely nothing to do with when rent is due, or when the eviction process can be started. They are entirely three different and distinctly separate timelines.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Rent is due on the 1st of each month...</strong>period! That means that an eviction process can be started on the 2nd of the month, regardless of when a payment may be considered "late" for charging late fees or any other penalty. So as an example, if a lease happened to stipulate that late fees wouldn't be charged, or rent was to be considered late until after the 15th of the month, there is the distinct possibility that a landlord could start the eviction process on the 2nd of the month and have a lock-out completed before the payment would be "late"... again, late in that fees could be charged.
        </p>
        <h3>Are Late Fees, Rent?</h3>
        <p>
        Most Rental Agreements stipulate that any outstanding charges, including late fees, become rent after they have gone unpaid for 30 days. So, yes, not paying your late fees or other charges means that you can be evicted for that as well since those amounts become rent. In our office, and with our agreements, we go a step further and stipulate that ALL outstanding charges, whether for late fees, utilities, or whatever, will be paid FIRST, before any funds are applied to rent owed.
        </p>
        <h3>Money Orders vs Personal Checks</h3>
        <p>
        Many tenants do not realize that personal checks (actually ANY type of check, including bank checks) are not legal tender and do not have to be accepted for payment. However, as a practical business matter, we do accept checks for the convenience of our tenants. We do not accept personal checks at the time of move-in, nor do we continue to accept checks with established tenants once a tenant has bounced one. A tenants account will be marked not to accept personal checks and should one be mailed in, it will be returned, unused. Also, if your payment is late, we will not accept a personal check. The above applies for electronic ACH payments as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Bad Luck and Excuses</h3>
        <p>After 30 years we've heard everything. Everyone has problems, all the time. It is your responsibility, no matter what the circumstance, to get your payments in when they are due. With the availability of Electronic Banking and Electronic Payments 24/7 from anywhere in the world, there really aren't any valid excuses. If you mail in a check, it is NOT the Post Offices, or the mailman's job to get your rent to us in a specific amount of time. If you are going to rely on the post man then you need to be ready to accept the fact that sometimes your payment is not going to get here on time and you are going to incur late fees. We would suggest that you use the electronic ACH payments that is free, or mail your rent at least two (2) weeks in advance in order to minimize any chance of slow mail.</p>
        <h3>Online Payments</h3>
        <p>
        Tenants are not required to make payments electronically. However, we offer three secure and easy ways for our tenants to pay online. You can pay by echeck (FREE), credit card (Fee) and by cash at your local 7-Eleven store (Fee). All three methods end up going through our Property Management software. The easiest way is via an echeck. To get started you need to request access by emailing your property manager. They will email you back with a login to your own secure tenant portal. You'll create a password and can start paying online immediately either through the web or at 7-Eleven.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Pay Online?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure</strong> - Online payments are encrypted using bank grade security</li>
            <li><strong>Fast</strong> - Your Payment is immediately posted to your account balance</li>
            <li><strong>Convenient</strong> - You can make payments anytime from anywhere</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible</strong> - Pay with whatever method best fits your needs</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> Maintenance
        <div class="tab-info">
        <p>
        The basic rule of thumb that is followed is "If you break it, clog it, or don't maintain it, then it's something you need to fix". If it breaks on it's own then the owner takes care of it. An example of what the owner would handle would be if the water heater started leaking, or the a/c stopped working because the compressor needed replacing. In other words, items that the tenant couldn't possibly be involved with... like repairing a leaky roof.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also, keep in mind that during the summer especially, and at times during the winter, when your heating or air conditioning is out, so is everyone else's. It is not unusual for a/c repair men to be booked solid a week in advance. There might be a delay in making the repair.
        </p>
        <p>
        Everything else is pretty much up to the tenant to keep working. Below are some common problems and their remedies. Remember, if you call for a repair and there really wasn't anything wrong, then you will be paying for the service call. You will also be paying for the service call if you are not present at the appointed time to let a tech fix the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Electrical Light or Outlet(s) not working.</strong> Usually this is caused by a breaker switch having been overloaded and tripped off. There are two areas to check. First the breaker box panel which is normally on the outside of the building, but could also be in a garage or tucked away in the back of a closet. First look to see if any of the switches have slightly moved away from the totally "on" position. If you see one that is, take and switch it completely to the "off" position before attempting to move it to the "on" position. Assuming that the breaker holds, this procedure should fix the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        A second type of breaker is found in areas of the home where there is water, usually in the kitchen or bathroom, but also in the garage. They are GFI breaker plugs and they control a wider area of plugs than just the spot they are located at. Consequently you could have a plug or plugs go out in a bathroom and it is a GFI breaker plug in a garage that has tripped. Find the culprit plug and push the "reset" button which is located in the middle of the plug. That should reset the power to the problem area.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Garbage Disposal</strong> - Your garbage disposal has gotten jammed, or is making a humming noise but not grinding. Usually something has gotten lodged along the inside wall of the disposal that is preventing them from working. On most models there is a "Reset" button on the bottom of the disposal. Make sure that it is pushed in and try the disposal again. If it didn't help the next step is to manually dislodge the interior grinding mechanism. This is done by inserting an allen wrench into the bottom of the disposal and twisting/cranking the wrench to get the mechanism freed up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Leaking Pipes/Water Heater</strong> - The first thing to do is get the water shut off. Every sink, toilet, water heater has a shut off valve next to the wall where the water is entering the apparatus from. TURN THE WATER OFF. Get towels or a mop and get the water soaked up. Do not let the water ruin carpet, walls, flooring etc. Call us immediately so we can get someone out to fix, repair, or complete clean-up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Clogs</strong> - If the clog is caused by normal use, then you need to call a plumber and deal with it. On rare occasion there might be old tree roots that have infiltrated the plumbing lines. In that case, it would be the owners responsibility to keep the pipes open.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Dishwashers</strong> - Many people are not in the habit of using a dishwasher... they like to do dishes by hand. That is well and good except that dishwashers have seals that can dry out and crack if the dishwashers are not used. Consequently, if you prefer to do dishes by hand, then you will need to run a cycle through the dishwasher once a week to keep the seals from leaking. Otherwise, when they dry out, you'll have a repair bill to deal with.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Other Maintenance Issues</strong> - Below is a list of common household items that can be used to clean and maintain the property.

        <p>
        Most tenants in Clark County are transplants from another state. They do not realize that State laws here, especially regarding tenant evictions, can be so radically different. Consequently, they are almost dumbfounded to find that an eviction has actually happened, to them.
        </p>
        <p>
        Because of the high transient nature of Clark County residents, the laws are written in favor of the property owner or landlord. The states forefathers quickly learned that everyone and his brother would soon come to Nevada to 'win' their fortunes in life at the tables. They needed a way to protect their investments from the hopeful masses. Consequently, they made it very easy to evict people whether it be out of casinos, hotels, or any other type of real estate.
        </p>
        <h3>Eviction time frames:</h3>
        <p>Evictions for non payment of rent typically takes 21 days, start to finish. Compare that with up to 3-6 months as an average in many other states. The process is straight forward.</p>
        <h3>Everyone has problems:</h3>
        <p>Tenants will normally find that property management firms in general are very unsympathetic to their situation... we have to be, otherwise we would go nuts taking on everyone else's problems. Everyone has problems in life, all the time. At this point, you have become a problem for us and the owner.</p>
        <h3>Avoiding an eviction:</h3>
        <p>The best way to avoid an eviction is to get money from anyone that doesn't have the power to evict you. That might include friends, relatives, social services, advances from work, or your church. Another surprise many tenants have is that the evictions actually do take place no matter what their circumstances may be.</p>

            <h3>Giving Notice</h3>
            <p>
            Most Rental Agreements, including ours, requires that a 30 day written notice be given when a tenant has decided to move. How exactly though does this work? Thirty days starting when? What other requirements are there of the notice?
            </p>
            <p>
                Many tenants get confused as to when they can move out without losing their deposit because of improper notice. Here again, giving the notice has nothing to do when you actually "physically" move. It has to do with the amount of rent paid and basically giving the owner notice that the rental stream is going to stop. You could have physically moved out months ago, and just kept paying rent for your own personal reasons... and then given 30 days notice in the last month of your agreement. The 30 day notice has more to do with money than with when you actually physically move. Having said that, most tenants give notice when they are ready to actually move.
            </p>
            <p>
            So there are two requirements. You must give a minimum of 30 days written notice, and it must be given on or before the first of the month. That means if you are moving out on the 15th of June, then your notice would have to be given on the 1st of May... which is 45 days early. Remember at least 30 days, and it must be on the 1st of any calendar month.
            </p>
            <h3>Middle of the Month</h3>
            <p>When you move in the middle of the month, with proper notice, you are still required to pay in advance for the days you anticipate on being in the property. We will still continue to start the eviction process, since you have not paid a full months rent. Then assuming you leave on time, the eviction will be terminated. Otherwise, you will be required to pay the balance of the rent owed, or the eviction will go forward.</p>
            <h3>Stopping the Rental Clock</h3>
            <p>You are charged for rent up until the time ALL the keys and remotes are returned... whether you moved out before returning these items or not. As long as you have possession of keys or a way to enter the property, then you are still in possession of the unit.</p>
            <h3>Final Inspection - Walk-thru</h3>
            <p>
            The final inspection will not be completed until you have completely moved out and either have or are returning the keys at the time of the inspection. It's impossible to inspect with furniture in the residence, and most often damage will occur during the move-out process.

        <div class="tab-info">
        <h3>Getting deposits back:</h3>
        <p>Most tenants are concerned with their ability to get their Security Deposits returned to them. First of all, we like to give all of the deposit back and we frequently return all or part of a tenants security deposit. However there are several things that you need to do.</p>
        <p>First of all, you will need to have all outstanding charges on your ledger paid. Secondly, you will need to give proper written notice that you will be vacating. Finally, the property has to be in ready to move-in condition. Most tenants don't want to go to that much trouble to get a place in shape. They ignore the little things like cleaning windows and blinds. Or they will attempt to clean the carpet themselves with less than adequate results. However, for those tenants that do what is necessary, we return their deposits.</p>
        <h3>Owner holding deposits:</h3>
        <p>It's much more difficult for us to return deposits if we never got them. Many times we'll get involved with a property after a tenant has moved in and they had given the owner their Security Deposit. In this instance the tenant will need to get in touch with the owner for the return of their deposit.. remember, we never had it.</p>
        <h3>Deposit returned - time frames:</h3>
        <p>It can take from a few days to as long as thirty (30) days to get your deposit returned to you. For the most part it depends on you. If the unit is rent ready, ready to go, it usually takes a few days. If there are repairs, and cleaning that need to be done, then probably it will be closer to 30 days. The more you do, then the less we need to do, and the faster a return can usually be made.</p>
        <p>You need to make sure that we have all of your forwarding information on file when you vacate. It's difficult to return deposits if we don't know where you've gone to.</p>
        <p><strong>Property Problems - Evictions</strong> If there has been an eviction, of if there is a lot of work to be done, it isn't likely that any portion of the deposit will be eligible to be returned. In fact, if there still remains unpaid charges for rent, court fees, or cleaning and repairs, it's possible that not only will all of a tenants deposit be used up, but that the remaining balance owed would be turned over to a collection agency or possibly small claims court.</p>
