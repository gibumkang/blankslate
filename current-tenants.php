        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up active-arrow"></i> WHEN IS RENT DUE?
        <div class="tab-info active">
        Rent is due on or before the 1st day of each month. Tenants get confused between when rent is due and when rent is late. The time frame for being "late" only concerns itself as to when we can add or charge additional fees for being late.  
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHEN ARE LATE FEES CHARGED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Typically, with leases that we write, rent is "late" on the 3rd of the month. It doesn't matter if the 1st, 2nd or 3rd all fall on a weekend or holiday days. Tenants have the option and obligation to get their payment in BEFORE the 1st of the month. There is nothing to prevent anyone from paying on the 26th, 27th or 28th prior to the 1st when the rent is due. That is the easiest and best way to avoid late charges.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY PERSONAL ITEMS IF THEY ARE DAMAGED IN A FIRE, FLOOD, OR BREAK-IN?
        <div class="tab-info">
        You are. You need to get renters insurance. You need to protect your own valuables. You need to take responsibility. Property owners carry insurance that protects what they own, the property. You need to carry insurance to protect what you own.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> IF YOU START AN EVICTION, AND I HAVE MONEY, DON'T YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        It depends on whether or not you have <strong>ALL OF THE MONEY.</strong> Once an eviction is started, other eviction charges and fees start to add up quickly. We are not "required" to take money unless it is for the full amount. And then it needs to be either cashiers check or money order... no personal or business checks. We can also "hold" your partial funds as additional Deposit until you get all of the money. <strong>In this case we ARE NOT accepting rent.</strong> The eviction process will continue and a game of "Beat The Constable" will begin. If you are successful, you will pay off your account in full and we will stop the eviction process before the Constable is at your door. It's entirely up to you.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT LATE RENT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        As long as it is before the end of the 5 day notice to Pay Or Quit, you are paying the entire balance owed, and your funds are in the form of a money order or cashiers check.
        </div>

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> CAN I BE EVICTED IF I DON'T PAY FOR REPAIRS?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Yes, if you are responsible for the repairs. Let's say as an example that you didn't take care of the lawn and we had to send someone out to maintain it. Those expenses would get charged to your ledger, according to your lease agreement. Then when you made a payment, those charges would be paid first. Assuming that you only paid an amount equal to your regular rent, your account will be short and "rent" will be owning. Most lease agreements also stipulate that ANY unpaid charge becomes "rent" due after 30 days... that includes any unpaid late fees. Sooo, the bottom line is you can basically be evicted over anything that remains unpaid on your ledger.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> DO YOU REALLY RETURN SECURITY DEPOSITS?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Yes, all the time. However, you have to leave the property in excellent condition. It has to be ready so that someone else could move right in. Most tenants don't want to go to that much trouble to get a place in shape. They ignore the little things like cleaning windows and blinds. Or they will attempt to clean the carpet themselves with less than adequate results. However, for those tenants that do what is necessary, we return their deposits.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO GET MY SECURITY DEPOSIT BACK?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Well, first of all, you will need to have all outstanding charges on your ledger paid. Secondly, you will need to give proper written notice that you will be vacating. Finally, the property has to be in ready to move-in condition.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT IS CONSIDERED PROPER NOTICE WHEN VACATING?
        <div class="tab-info">
        You need to give written notice at least 30 days in advance of your departure, and it must be on or just before the 1st of the month when the notice is given or presented to the office or your property manager.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET MY SECURITY DEPOSIT RETURNED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        In part, that depends on you. If the unit is rent ready, ready to go, it usually takes a few days. If there are repairs, and cleaning that need to be done, then probably it will be closer to 30 days. The more you do, the less we need to do, and the faster a return can possibly be made.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REPAIRS, CLEANING, AND OUTSTANDING CHARGES TOTAL MORE THAN THE DEPOSIT I HAVE?
        <div class="tab-info">
        That in part is up to the landlord. We usually turn over ledgers with outstanding balances to Collection Agency's. They in turn see to it that it gets on your credit bureau. Some owners are a little more aggressive and they start a Small Claims suit. It's not an enjoyable experience for anyone. Keep in mind, that everything is Tenant generated. In other words, if you did your part, had everything paid for, there wouldn't be any Collection Agency's or court actions involved.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> CAN I REPLACE SOME OF THE CEILING LIGHTS WITH CEILING FANS/LIGHTS?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Maybe. You need to check with your property manager. Keep in mind, that according to state law, anything that is attached to the property, like a ceiling fan, becomes part of the real estate and is no longer your personal property. It is part of the owners improved real estate. Technically, if you remove the ceiling fans when you vacate, you are stealing the owners property. It is best to get an agreement signed that allows you to remove the attached items before you install them. That way everybody is on the same page and there aren't any problems.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET A PET?
        <div class="tab-info">
        That depends on the owner, you, and the pet. Assuming that your lease has a no pet clause, then you are in violation of your lease and if the owner wants to enforce the clause, you'll be evicted. Sometimes, depending on the pet, the owner will allow you to pay a hefty, refundable, pet deposit. Here again, if you don't come up with the bucks, you'll be looking for a new place for both you and your new family addition. Usually, non destructive pets like fish, reptiles, and pet rocks (if they are well trained) aren't a problem.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T TAKE CARE OF THE YARD OR CHANGE AIR FILTERS?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Here again, once these things become apparent, normally we will order the work done and you will be charged for these items. Considering how easy it is to change a two (2) dollar filter, do you really want to pay $30 - $50 to have someone come out and do it?

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> CAN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION HAVE ME EVICTED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        In a word yes. HOA's are very powerful. You do not want to get on their bad side. They basically have everything written in their favor. It's kind of like fighting the government. Make sure you fully understand all of the rules and regulations for your complex. The best way to live in an Association is to keep very quiet, almost invisible. Make nice with your neighbors, and basically be so low key that nobody would ever even suspect that the property is occupied.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> CAN I GET CABLE OR PUT UP A SATELLITE DISH?
        <div class="tab-info">
        You will need to check with your property manager. Each situation is different. Here again, if you bought a satellite dish and you attach it to the building, keep in mind that it just became the owners satellite dish. Many Associations do not allow dishes because of the "look". Many owners don't allow dishes for the same reason. Usually, there are far fewer problems with getting cable.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHERE WAS MY CAR TOWED, AND WHY?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Usually, a car is towed because it doesn't meet general minimum operating guidelines, or it is parked in a restrictive place. First, every vehicle needs to be licensed and be registered. Secondly, it must be 100% operative and not a hazard. That means no flats, no broken or cracked widows or windshield, no missing doors etc. Obviously it can't run without an engine so the engine can't be pulled and being worked on. A residential property is not your own personal lube and tune. Sometimes vehicles find there way off of the driveway and on to another area of the property. This isn't good and we will have it towed if we find it that way. Many times neighbors will call us because they don't like the look this action is giving to the neighborhood. Your vehicle will normally be towed to Action Towing, 3050 Westwood Drive Suite A3 & 4, Las Vegas, NV 89109... (702) 737-9100.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHEN WILL YOU HAVE THE CARPET CLEANED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        When you move-out, unless you have it professionally cleaned. It was cleaned before you moved in. After that, it's your responsibility. You can have it cleaned as often as necessary at your own expense.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW DOES AN EVICTION WORK AFTER THE 5 DAY HAS EXPIRED?
        <div class="tab-info">
        The day after the 5 day expires, we fill out the necessary court forms and file with both the Justice Court and the Constable's office. From there the paperwork, including a copy of the 5 day Notice goes in front of the judge. This process can take 1-3 days depending on the courts work load. The judge will sign the Order for eviction and send it to the Constable's office. At that point, the Constable will normally post a 24 hour notice, again this could take a day or two depending on their work load. This notice is not required by the Constables office. They do it as a courtesy to you the tenant and of course they are like anybody else and would like to avoid as many problems as possible. The next day, assuming they did post a 24 hour notice, they will be back with a locksmith and will remove anyone and anything that is breathing. That includes pets. Your pets will go to the animal shelter if you are not there to take them with you. The same thing could happen to unattended children (minors) as they would end up in the Juvenile care system. The locksmith will change all the locks and you will not be allowed back into the property.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW DO I GET MY PERSONAL PROPERTY BACK AFTER I'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT?
        <div class="tab-info">
        You need to act quickly. We do not want your stuff. We want it out of the property <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong>, if not sooner. We will work with you and allow you access during the day to get your belongings. We will not allow this to be a long drawn out process. If you drag your feet and give us excuses why you can't act then we will move all your stuff into storage and then you can pay for all of the moving and storage fees to get it back. It isn't cheap. In any event, we will hold your items for thirty (30) days. At the end of that period, assuming you have not done what was necessary to redeem them, they will either be sold, given to charity, or discarded. Again, we don't want to have to go through this process and it's cheaper and easier for everyone if you step up, take responsibility, and get your items moved out of the property IMMEDIATELY!
