        <div class="tab-info active">
        Our goal is to process your applications as quickly as possible so that you will be able to make a determination on your housing needs without delay. Unfortunately, sometimes we are held up in this endeavor because of our inability to get a hold of previous landlords, current landlords, or employers.
        <p>
        Normally an application process takes 24 hours to complete. The more information you can provide on your Application, the easier it is to complete processing. <strong>WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WORK ON YOUR APPLICATION IF IT IS NOT SIGNED AND DATED.</strong> Signing the paperwork authorizes us to do the background checks and the people we make the inquiries to, to release information.

        We take every applicant on a case by case basis. Sometimes a tenants understanding of what bad credit is, isn't necessarily something we would view as a problem. Of course the opposite is true as well. Assuming your assessment is correct, then there is still a possibility that you would get accepted if the owner was willing to overlook your past credit problems.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE LEASE?
        <div class="tab-info">
        The terms of the lease can vary from month-to-month up to a year or even longer. Each tenant and owner have their own preferences. Each term also has its advantages and disadvantages. The longer the term, the longer you are committed to staying in the property. At the same time, a long term lease prevents the owner from raising the rent on you. Of course the opposite advantages and disadvantages apply to shorter term agreements.
        <p>
        Here is the excerpt from the Lease Agreement as it pertains to the lease term:
        </p>
        <h4>Terms</h4>
        LESSOR does hereby rent to LESSEE for residential purposes only those certain premises described as __ commonly known as, or located at:__
Clark County, Nevada for a Period of ___ month(s), commencing on the __ day of __ , 20 <strong>at a monthly rate of $__</strong> payable in advance on the <strong>FIRST</strong> day of each and every month. Payments will be accepted at 4033 W. Charleston Blvd. Las Vegas, Nevada 89102 during normal business hours Monday through Friday, not including holidays, unless otherwise agreed to. Rent payments are legally the responsibility of the LESSEE without notice or demand and may be acted upon anytime after the due date stated above. The LESSEE is responsible for all lease payments through the end of the lease term. All payments received on LESSEES account will <strong>FIRST</strong> be applied to late fees, repairs, utilities, returned check charges, and all other miscellaneous LESSEE charges and <strong>SECOND</strong> to rent due. At the end of the lease term this agreement will automatically become a month-to-month agreement with all of the stated provisions herein intact, unless a lease renewal or new lease has been signed and agreed upon. The Americana LC may make changes to this agreement at any time with proper written notice being given to LESSEE.

        <div class="tab-info">
        Rent is due on or before the first of the month. Don't let when rent becomes "late", confuse you with when it is actually due. These are two entirely separate time lines. You can pay your rent anytime before it is due.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> WHO DO I MAKE MY RENTAL PAYMENTS TO?
        <div class="tab-info">
        You will always make your payments out to us. We process the payment s and do the accounting for the different owners. If you are a Section 8 recipient, then HUD will also send the owners checks to us. Most of our tenants make their payments electronically, online or by going to their local 7-11 store.

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> DO YOU COME AND PICK UP THE RENT PAYMENTS?
        <div class="tab-info">
        No. Most tenants pay online through their bank account or credit card. Or, many tenants have "Bill Pay" through their bank handle their payments for them. You can also pay at any 7-11. In additiona we can provide you with mail in stickers if you would like. Otherwise we hold regular business hours for making payments at the office.

        <div class="tab-info">
        Most residential property is not designed for or zoned for handling a business. Our leases are against it. However, if your business is say Internet related, or possibly mail order, or you "invest", there is a good possibility that these types of businesses would be allowed. The key is "traffic". If you will never have a client come to your house, and consequently nobody in the neighborhood could tell you are running a business, then that might be "ok". Each situation will be looked at separately.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO PAY TO HOLD THE PROPERTY?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Each property and situation is different. Usually we require the entire Security Deposit to hold a property for longer than 2 weeks. These funds are subject to loss if you should change your mind and not take the property since we will be taking the property off the market and holding it just for you. Once you complete the lease and take possession, then these funds will be applied to your refundable Security Deposit. Normally a Security Deposit is approximately 90% of the rent. That is not always the case, but is a general rule of thumb, and there are times when it can even be more than the rent.

    </div>

    <div class="accordion-tab">
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> MY SPOUSE WORKS, CAN I JUST SIGN THE LEASE SO WE CAN MOVE-IN?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Unfortunately no. In fact this would be just the opposite of something that might even be remotely considered. If anything, initially we might allow not having the spouse that doesn't work not sign for some reason, and then have them come in later... not the other way around. Our standard policy is that everyone over the age of 18 that is going to live in the property, signs.... before keys are released.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW MUCH IS THE SECURITY DEPOSIT AND WILL I GET IT BACK WHEN I LEAVE?
        <div class="tab-info">
        The Security Deposit varies with each property and is usually around 90% of the rent. Sometimes it can be more and sometimes it is less. It depends on the situation and the owners requirements. Getting your Security Deposit back depends entirely on you. If you stick to all the requirements of the lease, give proper notice, and leave the property in a condition that we can immediately rent it with out having to do any repairs or cleaning, then you should get your Deposit returned.
        </div>

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> HOW MANY KEYS WILL I GET?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Normally we give you one set of keys and one gate and/or garage door opener if appropriate for the property. If you would like more sets then it will be your responsibility to have duplicate keys made and purchase additional remote controls. In the event you change locks on the property, it is imperative that you supply our office with a copy of the keys. Not to do so would be considered a lease violation and as such you could be evicted.
        <p>
        Here is the excerpt from the Lease Agreement as it pertains to keys:
        </p>
        <h4>
            Keys
        </h4>
        Access systems will be furnished to LESSEE when all parties have signed the lease and all applicable addendums, deposits and rent monies have been paid and a move-in date has occurred. LESSEE is responsible for and must return such keys, cards, openers etc. to be eligible for a refund of deposits. The above stated key deposit shall be refunded if keys consisting of _ door key(s), _ mail box key(s), __ laundry room key(s), __ pool key(s), __ storage key(s), _ gate card(s) ___ gate key(s), __ Transmitter(s), __ (_Other) key(s) are returned. Locks may be replaced, re-keyed, or dead bolts added at the tenant’s expense provided tenant informs owner, or owner’s agent, and provides owner, or owner’s agent, with a workable key for each new or changed lock. Tenants are responsible for all charges and expenses related to replacing lost, stolen, misplaced, or broken keys. Duplicate keys will only be made available to a tenant with proper identification and who is signed on this lease agreement. At no time will keys be given to minors, guests, or relatives.

        <div class="tab-info">
        We don't charge a cleaning fee, per se. We have found that when tenants do not have an opportunity of getting a refund, then there isn't any incentive for them to clean the property once they have vacated.

        <div class="tab-info">
            Late fees start on the third (3rd) of the month. On the third you are charged $50.00. After that, the late fee is increased $10.00 per day until a payment is accepted. Being late is never a good thing. Not only is it expensive, but you may be in a position to buy a home later and having lates on your rental record isn't going to help you secure a loan.
            <p>
                Here is the excerpt from the Lease Agreement as it pertains to Late Fees:
            </p>
            <h4>LATE</h4>
            LESSEE shall pay a charge of fifty ($50.00) dollars plus ten ($10.00) dollars for each day after two (2) days that rent is late. A charge of thirty-five ($35.00) dollars, plus the corresponding late fee will be charged for each dishonored check made by the LESSEE to the LESSOR. <strong>LESSEE agrees to pay all rents, all late fees, all notice fees, all outstanding charges, and all court costs upon honoring a returned check with Certified funds.</strong> After the LESSEE has tendered a check which is dishonored, LESSEE hereby agrees to pay all remaining payments due under this Agreement by Certified funds. Any payments tendered to LESSOR thereafter, which are not in the form of Certified funds, shall be treated as if LESSEE failed to make said payment until Certified funds are received. LESSEE shall pay all rental payments by Certified funds thereafter. LESSOR presumes that the LESSEE is aware of the criminal sanctions and penalties for issuance of a check which the LESSEE knows is drawn upon insufficient funds and which is tendered for the purpose of committing a fraud upon the creditor. 
            <strong>All late fees, service fees, and charges shall be due and payable when billed and after thirty (30) days shall become a part of the rents due.</strong>

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> IF I NEED TO MOVE CAN I SUBLET THE PROPERTY?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Probably not. However, we can usually work with you. What you need to understand and remember is that there is a legally binding agreement and the owner is basically saying, "I'm not going to force you to leave, and in return, you promise to stay". So, what you can do is find a replacement tenant. Similar to a sublet in that the property remains occupied but totally different in that you are released from your obligations and a new tenant signs a completely new Lease Agreement. This is actually better for you. It also is better for the owner because the new tenant normally signs a lease equal in term to the one you are exiting which in essence then extends his current cash flow expectations.
        <p>
        Here is the excerpt from the Lease Agreement as it pertains to subletting:
        </p>
        <h4>Sublet</h4>
        LESSEE shall not assign, sublet or transfer his interest, nor any part thereof, without prior written consent of the LESSOR, nor shall LESSEE use the premises for any commercial enterprise or for any purpose which is unlawful against State, Federal, City or County ordinances, nor shall LESSEE commit waste, excessive noise or create a nuisance in, on or about the premises or other unreasonable disturbances to others.

The manager needs to be notified immediately of any guests staying on the property and LESSEE agrees to pay the sum of twenty-five ($25.00) dollars per day for each guest remaining on the premises more than fourteen (14) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any guest remain on the premises for more than twenty (25) days.

        It depends on the property. The key is whether or not the meter, whether it be for gas, water, or power, handles more than one unit. If that particular utility meter does handle more than one unit then the owner pays for that particular utility. In single family homes, condos, or townhome's, which are all individually metered, then the tenant will always pay for their own utilities. The only exception is where the Homeowners Association pays for trash and in some older buildings that were converted from apartments or fourplexes, then possibly some of the other utilities might be master metered per building as well.

        This Agreement, upon completion of term, may be terminated by either party hereto giving to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior notice in writing on or before the first day of any given calendar month. Failure of either party to notify shall result in a month to month tenancy under the terms and conditions of this lease. This Agreement may be terminated at anytime by the owner or management company with 30 days written notice given to the LESSEE should the owner elect to put the property up for sale or be involved in a transaction to sell the property. In the event of court action, reasonable attorney’s fees, collection and processing fees may be awarded to the prevailing party and the losing party hereby obligates him/herself to pay same. If improper notice or no notice to vacate is given by LESSEE, LESSEE is liable for prorated rent until lawful termination and LESSOR may deduct this from the Damage/Security deposit on hand, or collect any monies due by other lawful means.

        Here is the excerpt from the Lease Agreement as it pertains to access:

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> DO YOU THINK THE OWNER WILL WANT TO SELL THIS PLACE?
        <div class="tab-info">
        Most tenants ask this question because they do not want to be forced to move in the near future. For the most part, the majority of owners hold on to their investments for a long time. That doesn't mean that their personal circumstances will never change or that they may need to sell for some reason, but for the most part they would rather hold on to the property and leave well enough alone. Usually they tell us if they are thinking about selling.

        It's not the owners responsibility to protect you or your personal belongings. Your losses are not his losses. You need to carry your own insurance just as the owner carries insurance to protect what is his, namely the property.
        <p>
        Here is the excerpt from the Lease Agreement as it pertains to insurance:
        </p>
        <h4>Insurance</h4>
        It is advisable that LESSEE should obtain renter's insurance as landlord's insurance does not cover LESSEE'S belongings. LESSOR shall not be liable for any damage or injury to LESSEE, or any other person, or to any property occurring on the premises or any part thereof, or in common areas thereof, unless such liability is based on the negligent acts or omission of LESSOR, his agent or employee, and LESSEE agrees to hold LESSOR harmless from any claims for damages if caused by the negligent acts or Omissions of the LESSEE or his family, licensees, guests and pets.

        <div class="tab-info">
        We answer them the same day we get them, usually within a few minutes. The issue is rarely how quickly we work, but more importantly how fast the repair tech is able to get to the property. This is something we have no control over. Especially if there is a property warranty program in place or if it is at the height of a particular season.... like the middle of summer when the a/c just went out along with 100,000(+) other peoples. With our vendors, usually a repair is completed within 24 hours.

        <div class="tab-info">
        Sometimes. Again it depends on the property and the tenant requirements. Water consumption here in the desert is a big concern. Most owners aren't wild about putting in a water guzzling yard that a tenant will probably ignore anyway and then will die during the hot summer months. An owner is more likely to put in rock. So where might that leave you. If you have kids, it usually leaves you with no place for them to play in the back. Consequently, many owners, and tenants prefer the dirt. You don't have to water it, it won't die, and the kids can play on it, dig it up, and do whatever they want to it.

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i> DO YOU DO A LEASE WITH OPTION TO BUY?
        <div class="tab-info">
        We advise our owners against it. There are a lot of legal issues involved. It's better for everyone to keep leases and purchases separate and not intermixed.
